# Robus

## Run the project
1: Add the path of the project in the main file, do not commit your path.

2: Open Blender and open main.py

3: Execute code in blender

## Info

Use the main in robus.py and not main.py. This is to avoid reloading the file every time we need to run it.

## Blender Dependency
___
To import bpy in pycharm you need to add this dependency:

```pip install fake-bpy-module-2.93```
